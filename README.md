# Caller

This is a simple Android application that acts as a **WebRTC** client for **[one2one](https://github.com/bromoapp/one2one)** project.
The role of this app in the context of **one2one** project is as **the caller** only.

As part of my learning in **WebRTC**, this project is successfully created with helps from many online sources, those are:

* https://tech.appear.in/2015/05/25/Introduction-to-WebRTC-on-Android/#Adding-the-WebRTC-library-to-your-project
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34065023/cannot-resolve-symbol-webrtc-in-android-studio
* https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/io/pristine/libjingle/
* https://github.com/pristineio/webrtc-android/blob/master/apprtc/src/main/java/org/appspot/apprtc/AppRTCDemoActivity.java

To test this application:
* Start one2one Phoenix application,
* Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser, and choose **"Goto Callee Page"**,
* And start this application in emulator,
* Click on **Connect** and **Call* button on Caller app, so the magic can works.
